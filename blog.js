The airplane made its maiden flight in August 1946, and in June 1948 the Strategic Air Command received its first operational B-36. Powered by six Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 engines, the B-36J cruised at 230 mph, but for additional bursts of speed its four General Electric J47s increased the maximum speed to 435 mph. It carried 86,000 pounds of nuclear or conventional bombs. When production ended in August 1954, more than 380 B-36s had been built for the U.S. Air Force. In 1958-1959, the USAF replaced the B-36 with the all-jet B-52. ",

      body: "Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge. Often referred to as the &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot;, it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire.  It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.",

      body: "The Welsh Corgi (/?k??r?i/[5] or Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn; /?k??r?u?n/) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is derived from the Welsh meaning &quot;dwarf&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;, respectively. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 14th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.",

      body: "The Convair B-58 Hustler, designed and produced by American aircraft manufacturer Convair, was the first operational bomber capable of Mach 2 flight. The B-58 was developed during the 1950s for the United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command (SAC). To achieve the high speeds desired, Convair chose a delta wing design used by contemporary interceptors such as the Convair F-102. The bomber was powered by four General Electric J79 engines in underwing pods. It had no bomb bay; it carried a single nuclear weapon plus fuel in a combination bomb/fuel pod underneath the fuselage. Later, four external hardpoints were added, enabling it to carry up to five weapons.",

B-29s dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only aircraft ever to drop nuclear weapons in combat.",

The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300â€“800 kg (660â€“1,760 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.",

The latter focuses on building one rocket and strenuously designing and testing it on the ground before its first flight — taking years but pretty much guaranteeing success on the first launch.\r\n\r\nSpaceX, however, rapidly builds new prototypes and is willing to test them to their breaking point because there&#039;s usually a spare nearby. During a drive by the company&#039;s facilities on Thursday — three Starship spacecraft and one Super Heavy booster could be seen from public roadways.",
